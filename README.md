Download scores report for Moodle SCORM
=======================================

This report provides buttons to download a spreadsheet of scores for a SCORM package. It differs from the basic report by giving the total score in raw marks and percentage, as well as scores for each SCORM objective (called "question").

It's designed for Numbas tests, so it assumes there's only one SCO and that objectives map to questions.
